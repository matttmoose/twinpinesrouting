    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Born from the quiet of the digital forest and the chaos of a flux field, Twin Pines Tech was founded by those who saw tomorrow and reverse-engineered it. We’ve been architecting the future since before it needed scaling.</p>

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>We believe in the wisdom of trees and the precision of circuits. We prune complexity. We graft innovation. We listen to the root system and branch boldly upward.</p>

    <h2>Our Pine Code</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Build things that outlast the seasons</li>
      <li>Always leave the timeline cleaner than you found it</li>
      <li>Stay rooted, grow upward</li>
    </ul>
